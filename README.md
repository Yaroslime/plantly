# plantly
C++ apliocation that allows users to easily take care of their plants, and more.

The app Plantly is developed by Jarosław Szekuła for the subject of Projekt C++ on Uniwersytet Wrocławski. This is NOT the final look or the final platform. This look was only created to present the idea and show what it is about.

The app is going to be developed for Windows and MacOS,  using programming language C++, with small design changes (to make it usable on horizontal screens). 

It is NO estimated date for final developed version for smartphones, yet.
